Key points to consider:
1. Simple greetings, acknowledgments, or social pleasantries do not require database querying.
2. Only classify a message as needing retrieval if it explicitly or implicitly requests information beyond basic conversation.
3. Determine if the user's query requires specific knowledge that might not be part of the model's general understanding.
4. Consider the context of the conversation. If a query relates to previously discussed specific topics, it might require retrieval.

Categorize the task as either:
- False (no retrieval needed): For greetings, simple acknowledgments, or queries that can be handled with general knowledge.
- True (retrieval may be necessary): For specific information requests, complex queries, or topics that might require up-to-date or specialized knowledge.

Your response should be in JSON format with two fields:
* thoughts: A concise string explaining your reasoning.
* response: A boolean value where True indicates that database querying is needed, and False indicates it is not needed.

Example response format:
{"thoughts": "Your concise reasoning here", "response": <Boolean_Response>}

Analyze the latest user message carefully within the context of the chat history. Ensure your response is a single-line JSON object."""

2. For each item, determine if it is relevant to the user's latest message in the chat history.

Key responsibilities:
1. Evaluate if the existing query-context pairs and singular queries provide enough information to accurately answer the user's latest message.
2. If the current information is insufficient, generate new, focused queries to fill the knowledge gaps.
3. Ensure that new queries are as specific and "separable" as possible. Break down complex queries into simpler, more targeted ones.

Guidelines for query generation:
1. Aim for clarity and precision in each new query.
2. Avoid overlapping or redundant queries.
3. Break down multi-faceted questions into individual components.
4. Consider different aspects or perspectives related to the user's question that might require separate queries.

Your response should be in JSON format with two fields:
* thoughts: A string explaining your reasoning process, including what the current queries are lacking and why new queries are needed.
* response: A list of new queries as strings. If no new queries are needed, this list should be empty.

Key responsibilities:
1. Evaluate if you can generate a plausible hypothetical document for the given query.
2. If possible, create a clear, concise, and queryable hypothetical answer.
3. If not possible, explain why and indicate that generation is not feasible.

Guidelines for hypothetical document generation:
1. For general knowledge, common concepts, linguistic tasks, logical reasoning, and well-known facts, you can usually generate good hypothetical documents.
2. Be cautious with very recent events (post-December 2023), highly specific information, rapidly changing fields, personal data, complex numerical data, and highly technical content.
3. If you cannot generate a plausible document, set 'generate' to False and provide an empty string as the response.
4. If you can generate a "look-alike" answer for technical terms or concepts you're unsure about, attempt to do so and set 'generate' to True.
5. For queries within your knowledge base, confidently generate a response and set 'generate' to True.

Your response should be in JSON format with three fields:
* thoughts: A string explaining your reasoning process, including why you can or cannot generate a hypothetical document.
* generate: A boolean value indicating whether you've generated a hypothetical document (True) or not (False).
* response: The generated hypothetical document as a string. If generation is not possible, this should be an empty string.

Example response format:

Key responsibilities:
1. Analyze the original query and the retrieved chunks carefully.
2. Determine if the chunks contain information that is directly related to and useful for answering the query.
3. Provide a clear rationale for your decision.

Guidelines for evaluation:
1. Consider the semantic relevance of the chunks to the query, not just keyword matching.
2. Assess whether the chunks provide specific information that addresses the query's main points.
3. Be critical - even if chunks contain related information, they should be sufficiently specific and helpful to qualify as relevant.
4. Consider the completeness of the information in relation to the query.

Your response should be in JSON format with two fields:
* thoughts: A string explaining your reasoning process, including why you believe the chunks are or are not helpful in answering the query.
